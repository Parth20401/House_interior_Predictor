# House Interior Predictor

## Project Objectives :
The objective of the project is to apply Deep Learning Algorithms (like EfficientNet) to create a model. We are preforming Classification and our aim is to tell whether a particular room of a house (Bedroom, Balcony, etc.) is Modern or Old with good accuracy. 


## Data Collection :
The dataset is obtained from Kaggle.

## Modelling :
The model creation can be found in the .ipynb file. 

The main packages used are EfficientNet, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn.


## More Info. :
The web app has been build using basic HTML, CSS and Flask.
